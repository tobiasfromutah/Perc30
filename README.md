# About
**IMPORTANT**
I'm not sure if the bookmark works due to chromes heavy 

This is a beta Chrome Modding Shell (CMS) intended to modify Chrome past its capibilities in javascript, this project is mainly for enrolled devices and removing restrictions.

Supported Devices:
* Windows (Mainly)
* ChromeOS (You HAVE to have a way to run javascript Eg: Bookmarklet, TamperMoney, Or the recomended Devtools)
  
# How to use
For now you can only copy and paste into the Devoloper console. OR you can run it as a bookmark now (please forgive me if this doesn't work and report all issues. just run it in here and use the output as the bookmark.)
* Heres the link for the [bookmarklet maker](http://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker)
